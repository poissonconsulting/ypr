## Introduction

[`ypr`](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/ypr) is an R package that implements equilibrium-based yield per recruit methods.
Yield per recruit methods can used to estimate the optimal yield [@walters_fisheries_2004] of a fish population with one or more ecotypes.
The yield can be based on the number of fish caught (or harvested) or biomass for all fish or just large (trophy) individuals.

The key life history parameters are

- The growth coefficient (`k`) and mean maximum length (`Linf`) from the Von Bertalanffy growth curve
- The length at which 50% mature (`Ls`)
- The length at which 50% vulnerable to harvest (`Lv`)
- The **annual interval** natural mortality rate (`n`)
- The lifetime number of spawners per spawner at low density (`Rk`)

and in the case of ecotypes

- The relative proportion of recruits that belong to that ecotype (`RPR`)

The calculations do not account for stochasticity, predator-prey dynamics, angler responses or density-dependent growth.

## Demonstration

### Schedule

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
library(ypr)
population <- ypr_population(Rk = 5, Ls = 50, Rmax = 100, rho = 0.6)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, x = "Length", y = "Spawning")
ypr_tabulate_schedule(population)
```

### Fish

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ypr_plot_fish(population, color = "white")
ypr_tabulate_fish(population)
```

### Stock-Recruitment

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ypr_plot_sr(population)
ypr_tabulate_sr(population)
```

### Yield

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ypr_tabulate_yield(population)
ypr_plot_yield(population)
```

### Interaction

To interactively explore the effects of altering individual parameters on the schedule, stock-recruitment and yield see the ypr shiny [app](https://poissonconsulting.shinyapps.io/shinyypr/).
