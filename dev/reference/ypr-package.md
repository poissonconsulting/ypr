# ypr: Yield Per Recruit

An implementation of equilibrium-based yield per recruit methods. Yield
per recruit methods can used to estimate the optimal yield for a fish
population as described by Walters and Martell (2004)
\<isbn:0-691-11544-3\>. The yield can be based on the number of fish
caught (or harvested) or biomass caught for all fish or just large
(trophy) individuals.
