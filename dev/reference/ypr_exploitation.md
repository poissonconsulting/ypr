# Exploitation Probability

Converts capture probabilities into exploitation probabilities based on
the release and handling mortality probabilities where the probability
of exploitation includes handling mortalities. The calculation assumes
that a released fish cannot be recaught in the same year.

## Usage

``` r
ypr_exploitation(object, pi = ypr_get_par(object))
```

## Arguments

- object:

  The population or populations.

- pi:

  A vector of capture probabilities to calculate the exploitation
  probabilities for.

## Value

A vector of exploitation probabilities.

## Details

In the case of no release (or 100% handling mortalities) the
exploitation probability is identical to the capture probability.
Otherwise it is less.

## Examples

``` r
ypr_exploitation(ypr_population(pi = 0.4))
#> [1] 0.4
ypr_exploitation(ypr_population(pi = 0.4, rho = 0.6, Hm = 0.2))
#> [1] 0.208
```
