Equilibrium based yield per recruit (YPR) methods (Walters and Martell
2004) estimate the capture rate that optimizes the yield under the
assumption that there is no stochasticity and all density-dependence is
captured by the stock-recruitment relationship. The remaining population
processes of growth, reproduction and death are captured through a
series of relatively straight-forward deterministic equations.

## Growth

### Length

In `ypr` length (in cm) at age (t) is assumed to follow a Von
Bertalanffy growth curve

L = L\_{\infty} \cdot (1 - \exp(-k \cdot (t-t_0)))

``` r
population <- ypr_population()
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Age", "Length")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

which can be biphasic

``` r
ypr_plot_schedule(ypr_population_update(population, L2 = 75, Linf2 = 200), "Age", "Length")
#> Warning: `ypr_population_update()` was deprecated in ypr 0.5.3.
#> ℹ Please use `ypr_update()` instead.
#> This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
#> Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was
#> generated.
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

### Weight

The weight (W) at a given length is assumed to follow the classic
allometric relationship

W = w\_\alpha \cdot L^{w\_\beta}

``` r
population <- ypr_population_update(population, Wa = 0.01, Wb = 3)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "Weight")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

Its worth noting that w\_\alpha, which is the extrapolated weight (g) of
a 1 cm individual, is a scaling constant that only affects the estimate
of the yield (when calculated in terms of the biomass), ie, it does not
affect the estimate of the optimal capture rate.

## Reproduction

### Fecundity

The fecundity (F) is assumed to scale allometrically with the weight
according to the equation

F = f\_\alpha \cdot W^{f\_\beta}

``` r
population <- ypr_population_update(population, fa = 1, fb = 1)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Weight", "Fecundity")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

f\_\alpha, which is the extrapolated eggs produced by a 1 g female, is a
scaling constant with no effect on the yield or optimal capture rate.

### Spawning

The probability of spawning at length L is determined by the equation

S = \frac{L^{S_p}}{L_s^{S_p} + L^{S_p}} \cdot es

``` r
population <- ypr_population_update(population, Ls = 50, Sp = 10, es = 0.8)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "Spawning")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

## Death

### Natural Mortality

By default the natural annual interval mortality rate (n) is assumed to
be constant

``` r
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "NaturalMortality")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

although like growth it can vary biphasically

``` r
ypr_plot_schedule(ypr_population_update(population, nL = 0.15, Ln = 60), "Length", "NaturalMortality")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

The natural mortality rate can also be affected by spawning mortality

``` r
population <- ypr_population_update(population, Sm = 0.5)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "NaturalMortality")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

### Fishing Mortality

The vulnerability to capture (V) is assumed to vary by length as follows

V = \frac{L^{V_p}}{L_v^{V_p} + L^{V_p}}

``` r
population <- ypr_population_update(population, Lv = 50, Vp = 50)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "Vulnerability")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

If V_p is 100 then vulnerability is effectively knife-edged.

The probabilty of being retained if captured (R) depends on the release
rate (\rho), the slot limits (L\_{lo} and L\_{up}) and the
non-compliance with the limits (N_c)

``` r
population <- ypr_population_update(population, rho = 0.5, Llo = 40, Lup = 70, Nc = 0.1)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "Retention")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

The fishing mortality (U) depends on V, R and the probability of capture
when fully vulnerable (pi) as well as the hooking mortality (H_m)

U = V \cdot \pi \cdot R + V \cdot \pi \cdot (1 - R) \cdot H_m

The calculation assumes that a released fish cannot be recaught in the
same year.

``` r
population <- ypr_population_update(population, pi = 0.3, Hm = 0.2)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "FishingMortality")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

## Recruitment

With growth, reproduction and death defined, the final task is to
estimate the recruitment (birth) rate.

This requires the lifetime number of spawners per spawner at low density
(R_k) and the recruitment age (R_t; by default 1) to be defined.

If recruitment follows a Beverton-Holt (BH = 1) curve then

R = \frac{\alpha \cdot E}{(\beta \cdot E + 1)}

``` r
population <- ypr_population_update(population, Rk = 3)
ypr_plot_sr(population, plot_values = FALSE)
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

where E is the annual eggs (stock) and R is the annual recruits at age
R_t.

With a Ricker curve (BH = 0) the relationship is as follows

R = \alpha \cdot E \cdot \exp (-\beta \cdot E)

``` r
population <- ypr_population_update(population, BH = 0L)
ypr_plot_sr(population, plot_values = FALSE)
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

The number of recruits at the carrying capacity (R\_\text{max}) is a
scaling constant that only affects the estimate of the yield.

Before calculating the recruitment it is important to introduce the
concept of the (unfished) survivorship (lx_a) which is the probability
of a recruit surviving to age a in the absence of fish mortality.

``` r
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Age", "Survivorship")
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

The unfished survivorship (lx_a) is defined recursively by

lx\_{R_t} = 1, lx_a = lx\_{a-1} \cdot (1-N\_{a-1}) \\\text{for}\\ a \>
R_t where N_a is the annual interval natural mortality at age a.

And the fished survivorship (lx_a^F) is

lx\_{R_t}^F = 1, lx_a^F = lx\_{a-1}^F \cdot (1 - (1 - N\_{a-1}) \cdot
(1 - U\_{a-1})) \\\text{for}\\ a \> R_t

The lifetime number of eggs deposited per (unfished) recruit (\phi) is
then just

\phi = \sum\_{a = R_t}^{t\_\text{max}} lx_a \cdot F_a/2 \cdot S_a where
t\_\text{max} is the maximum age considered (by default 20) and F_a the
fecundity at age a is divided by two as the sex ratio is assumed to 1:1
and S_a is the probability of spawning.

The fished equivalent is denoted \phi_F.

It important to realize that at the unfished equilibrium the annual
number of recruits (R_0) is related to the annual egg deposition
according to the following equation

E_0 = \phi \cdot R_0

By definition

\alpha = \frac{R_k \cdot R_0}{E_0} = \frac{R_k}{\phi}

The \beta term of the Beverton-Holt curve can then be found by
rearranging the following formula

R_0 = \frac{\alpha \cdot \phi \cdot R_0}{\beta \cdot \phi \cdot R_0 + 1}

\beta \cdot \phi \cdot R_0 + 1 = \alpha \cdot \phi

\beta = \frac{\alpha \cdot \phi - 1}{\phi \cdot R_0}

The equivalent equation for the Ricker curve is arrived at as follows

R_0 = \alpha \cdot \phi \cdot R_0 \cdot \exp (-\beta \cdot \phi \cdot
R_0)

\frac{1}{\exp (-\beta \cdot \phi \cdot R_0)} = \alpha \cdot \phi

\beta \cdot \phi \cdot R_0 = \log(\alpha \cdot \phi)

\beta = \frac{\log(\alpha \cdot \phi)}{\phi \cdot R_0}

The number of recruits at the fished equilibrium (R\_{0F}) can then be
found for the Beverton-Holt curve as follows

R\_{0F} = \frac{\alpha \cdot \phi_F \cdot R\_{0F}}{\beta \cdot \phi_F
\cdot R\_{0F} + 1}

\beta \cdot \phi_F \cdot R\_{0F} + 1 = \alpha \cdot \phi_F R\_{0F} =
\frac{\alpha \cdot \phi_F - 1}{\beta \cdot \phi_F}

and for the Ricker

R\_{0F} = \alpha \cdot \phi_F \cdot R\_{0F} \cdot \exp (-\beta \cdot
\phi_F \cdot R\_{0F})

\frac{1}{\exp(-\beta \cdot \phi_F \cdot R\_{0F})} = \alpha \cdot \phi_F

\beta \cdot \phi_F \cdot R\_{0F} = \log(\alpha \cdot \phi_F)

R\_{0F} = \frac{\log(\alpha \cdot \phi_F)}{\beta \cdot \phi_F}

Finally the estimates are rescaled so that the carrying capacity is
identical to R\_\text{max} through the following transformations

\beta = \beta \cdot \kappa / R\_\text{max} R_0 = R_0 / \kappa \cdot
R\_\text{max} R\_{0F} = R\_{0F} / \kappa \cdot R\_\text{max}

where \kappa, which is the carrying capacity in the original scale, is
\alpha/\beta for the Beverton-Holt and \alpha/(\beta \cdot e) for the
Ricker curve.

## Yield

When the yield is simply the number of fish caught (irrespective of the
weight or whether or not its harvested) then it is given by

Y = \sum\_{a = R_t}^{t\_\text{max}} R\_{0F} \cdot lx_a^F \cdot \pi \cdot
V_a

if only harvested fish are considered it becomes

Y = \sum\_{a = R_t}^{t\_\text{max}} R\_{0F} \cdot lx_a^F \cdot \pi \cdot
V_a \cdot R

and if the total weight (in kg) is important then its

Y = \sum\_{a = R_t}^{t\_\text{max}} R\_{0F} \cdot lx_a^F \cdot \pi \cdot
V_a \cdot R \cdot W_a/1000

and if only trophy fish are to be considered then its

Y = \sum\_{a = R_t}^{t\_\text{max}} \text{if}(La \< L_y)\\ 0\\
\text{else}\\ R\_{0F} \cdot lx_a^F \cdot \pi \cdot V_a \cdot R \cdot
W_a/1000 where L_y is the minimum length of a trophy fish.

``` r
ypr_plot_yield(population, harvest = TRUE, biomass = TRUE, Ly = 60)
```

![](ypr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)

``` r
ypr_tabulate_yield(population, harvest = TRUE, biomass = TRUE, Ly = 60)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 8

```

## Efficiency

The catchability `q` indicates the probability of capture for a unit of
effort (E). It is assumed to be related to \pi according to the
relationship \pi = 1 - \exp(\log(1-q)\cdot E) which can be rearranged to
give E = \frac{\log(1-\pi)}{\log(1-q)}.

ypr_plot_yield(population, y = "Effort", harvest = TRUE, biomass = TRUE, Ly = 60)
